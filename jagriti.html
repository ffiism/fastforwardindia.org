            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            In today's competitive world, it is not the fittest who survives, but it is the one who is most adaptive to
            change. Life today has become so fast that we are dependent on machines for most of our work. Computers have
            penetrated our lives so deep that to achieve professional success in any field, crossing paths with computer
            education has become indispensable. In a country like India where most people are deprived of basic
            necessities for life, computer education for these underprivileged children is a distant dream. Keeping the
            current scenario in mind, Jagriti was proposed as a part of Fast Forward India to impart basic computer
            education free of cost to the underprivileged children in and around Dhanbad. Jagriti started its
            functioning in 2008 and since then has been actively involved in achieving its goals and fulfilling this
            cause.
            We are trying to empower them with basic computer education needs so that they will be able to make their
            stand in this computer-oriented world.

            Our Vision
        </h2>
        <p>
            This chapter of ffi was started with a vision to empower underprivilage students with computer education so
            that they can stand in this changing era of india, also computer education for those people who are
            diconncted from society and want to change themselves so that they can serve and live in society with
            selfrespect.

            Admissions for all courses under Jagriti start at the beginning of each academic session. Children are then
            divided into batches according to their age and on the extent of the computer knowledge they possess (if
            any). Both theory and practical classes are taken at the FFI centre regularly by Jagriti volunteers. The
            various courses under Jagriti are as follows: Aadhar: Under this project, very basic knowledge of computers
            is provided. The beginner's course structure is designed keeping in mind that the students possess no prior
            knowledge of computers and is of 10 weeks duration including the final test.
            <br><br>
            The following topics are taught under Aadhar:
            <br>
            Understanding the Hardware of the computer and their functions.
            <br>
